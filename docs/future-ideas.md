# Future Ideas

Ideas and feature requests for Steve's Simple Storage. Tracked as GitHub issues at [scuba10steve/steves-simple-storage](https://github.com/scuba10steve/steves-simple-storage/issues).

## New Blocks / Components

- **Smelting Box tiers** — tiered versions of the smelting box, similar to storage box tiers ([#4](https://github.com/scuba10steve/steves-simple-storage/issues/4))
- **Memory Box** — stores crafting recipes and enables auto-crafting from the storage system ([#5](https://github.com/scuba10steve/steves-simple-storage/issues/5))
- **Colored cables** — cosmetic or functional cable variants for multiblock connections ([#6](https://github.com/scuba10steve/steves-simple-storage/issues/6))

## Cross-Mod Integration

- **Inventory Exposure Block** — a new block that exposes the S3 inventory to external mod systems such as Refined Storage, Simple Storage Networks, or Storage Drawers ([#7](https://github.com/scuba10steve/steves-simple-storage/issues/7))
- **Item tooltips / WAILA support** — add vanilla hover tooltips in the storage core GUI and hooks for WAILA/HWYLA/Jade ([#11](https://github.com/scuba10steve/steves-simple-storage/issues/11))

## Networked Storage

- **Multi-system networking** — connect multiple Storage Core systems via physical bridges, conduits, or wireless links ([#8](https://github.com/scuba10steve/steves-simple-storage/issues/8))

## Configuration / Balance

- **Per-type storage box limits** — config option to limit how many storage boxes of each tier can be added to a single system ([#9](https://github.com/scuba10steve/steves-simple-storage/issues/9))
- **Expanded capacity options** — increase upper-tier storage capacities (e.g. hyper storage to 25 million) ([#10](https://github.com/scuba10steve/steves-simple-storage/issues/10))
