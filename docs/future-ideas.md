# Future Ideas

Ideas and feature requests for Steve's Simple Storage, sourced from the original README and upstream EZStorage2 issues ([zerofall/EZStorage2](https://github.com/zerofall/EZStorage2)).

## New Blocks / Components

- **Smelting Box tiers** — tiered versions of the smelting box, similar to storage box tiers (#25)
- **Memory Box** — stores crafting recipes and enables auto-crafting from the storage system (#25)
- **Colored cables** — cosmetic or functional cable variants for multiblock connections (#25)

## Cross-Mod Integration

- **Inventory Exposure Block** — a new block that exposes the S3 inventory to external mod systems such as Refined Storage, Simple Storage Networks, or Storage Drawers (#51, #55, #77)

## Networked Storage

- **Multi-system networking** — connect multiple Storage Core systems via physical bridges, conduits, or wireless links

## Configuration / Balance

- **Per-type storage box limits** — config option to limit how many storage boxes of each tier can be added to a single system (#74)
- **Expanded capacity options** — increase upper-tier storage capacities (e.g. hyper storage to 25 million) (#75)
